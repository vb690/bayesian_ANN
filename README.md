# Bayesian Artificial Neural Networks
Small project for exploring the usage of bayesian artificial neural networks implemented with PyMC3.

## Motivation

## Features

1. PymC3 implementations of various Artificial Neural Networks layers "a la Keras":

    * Dense Layer
    * Embedding Layer
    * Vanilla RNN Layer
    * LSTM Layer

2. Flexible pirors specification.
3. Set of pre-implemented Artificial Neural Networks with flexible likelyhood specification:
    
    * Multilayer Perceptron
    * Word Embedding 

## Usage

###  Model Specification
```python
```

### Using pre-implemented models
```python
```
### Notebooks

1. Binary and multiclass classification.
2. Sampling the embedding.
3. Language Model.
